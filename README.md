# Helmholtz-Embodied-Inference-Salience-Sampling

In this research, we integrate action (salience sampling) into [perception](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15249-0) to study the enactive, [embodied mind](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29887647/) and [situated agents](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Whatever%20next.pdf) by the unified brain theory – the [Free Energy Principle](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2787), with an implementation within the Helmholtz machine infrastructure.

- The very first paper of this research, [A Neural Network Implementation for FEP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06792), was presented at the 4th International Workshop on Active Inference (IWAI 2023), in Ghent, Belgium [[poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WcqMUxAj-YVRW33nfturlazXT17N-bms/view)].
- The blueprint of this research was outlined in my publication [A New Theory of Data Processing: Applying Artificial Intelligence to Cognition and Humanity](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3577190.3616123), presented at the 25th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI 2023), Paris, France, as the [Blue Sky Paper](https://icmi.acm.org/2023/call-for-blue-sky-papers/) that "emphasizes innovative, visionary, and high-impact contributions" [[paper award](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17B7YcH6yYmIA72H0vBXe0V1XoZg0GK5a/view?usp=sharing), [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TiFpsldkKIJ5-Z7B6uTRh9AKJnBTmJ56/view), [Kudos](https://www.growkudos.com/publications/10.1145%25252F3577190.3616123/reader)].
- Presented at the [GenAI Summit 2025](https://genaisummit2025.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego [[poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gp1lqMNEjelwnmr1F7LP57hrafd9EsJ6/view?usp=sharing)].
- This work is detailed in Chapter 5 of my [Ph.D. qualification writing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CNLO2FjDNW5RT0Zfc70ynZeVdm-KQsTH/view?pli=1), 2024, and included in the Chapter 3 of my [Ph.D. dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/openview/581cd124d0c14930d566ba9010cecd67/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), 2025.
